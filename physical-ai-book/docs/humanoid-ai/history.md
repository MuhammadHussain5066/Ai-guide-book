# History of Humanoid AI

The journey of humanoid robotics spans decades of innovation, from early mechanical automata to today's sophisticated AI-powered robots.

## Timeline

### 1950s-1960s: Early Concepts
- Basic mechanical humanoid designs
- Limited mobility and functionality

### 1970s-1980s: First Walking Robots
- **WABOT-1** (1973): First full-scale humanoid robot
- Development of bipedal locomotion

### 1990s-2000s: Advanced Mobility
