# Robotics Basics

Understanding the fundamental concepts of robotics is essential for working with humanoid AI systems.

## What is Robotics?

Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots - automated machines that can carry out complex actions.

## Core Components

### 1. Mechanical Structure
- **Body/Frame**: Physical skeleton that provides structure
- **Joints**: Enable movement and flexibility
- **End effectors**: Hands, grippers, or specialized tools
- **Links**: Connect joints together

### 2. Sensors
- **Vision**: Cameras for visual perception
- **Touch**: Force and pressure sensors
- **Position**: Encoders and IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units)
- **Audio**: Microphones for sound detection
- **Distance**: LIDAR, ultrasonic, infrared sensors

### 3. Actuators
- **Electric Motors**: Servo motors, stepper motors
- **Pneumatics**: Air-powered systems
- **Hydraulics**: Fluid-powered systems for heavy loads
- **Artificial muscles**: Shape-memory alloys

### 4. Control Systems
- **Microcontrollers**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi
- **Software**: Decision-making algorithms
- **Power systems**: Batteries and power management
- **Communication**: WiFi, Bluetooth, networking

## Types of Robots

### 1. Industrial Robots
- Manufacturing and assembly
- Welding and painting
- Material handling
- High precision, repetitive tasks

### 2. Service Robots
- Healthcare assistance
- Cleaning and maintenance
- Food delivery
- Personal assistance

### 3. Humanoid Robots
- Human-like interaction
- Research and development
- Entertainment
- Social applications

### 4. Mobile Robots
- Autonomous navigation
- Exploration and mapping
- Delivery services
- Warehouse automation

### 5. Collaborative Robots (Cobots)
- Work safely alongside humans
- Easy to program and deploy
- Flexible applications
- Industrial and service sectors

## Robot Degrees of Freedom

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)** = Number of independent movements a robot can make

- **1-3 DOF**: Simple pick-and-place
- **6 DOF**: Full 3D positioning and orientation
- **Humanoid**: 20+ DOF for natural movement
